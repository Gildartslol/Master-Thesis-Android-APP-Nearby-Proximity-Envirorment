# Master thesis
## Android application development for proximity environments

In this Final Master Project we want to focus in a currently very popular topic. Nowadays,
the development of applications for Android mobile environments.The aim of the
application will be to offer services in proximity environments, such as sending
point-to-point files, or from one point to several receivers, point-to-point encrypted chats
or sending messages through notifications.

By proximity environment we understand everything that is close and with which we
can establish a connection through technologies such as Bluetooth or Wifi (within 100
metres). In this application we will not use mobile data(GPRS,3G or 4G) under any
circumstances, as is one of the main advantages, saving data while sending large files
as well as the possible communication between people in environments where
telecommunications networks are saturated.

To add value to this Master project, messages sent between users have been
encrypted using public and private key certificates, encrypted in Hash and AES keys.
Finally, it has to be highlighted the fact that at the beginning of this Final Master Project
my experience and previous knowledge about development using the Android
framework was nonexistent. Therefore, an additional effort has been done to reach an
starting level on Android development. However, to fully comprehend this document, it
is required to have some context on Android development, since the most basic parts
of Android such as activities, views, dialogs and their dynamic creation are not going to
be explained. Assuming that the main point of the work is to learn about the proximity
technologies and in particular the Google API Nearby and the functionality it provides.
